        "Scholars, journalists, and climate activists frequently distinguish between \"individual\" and \"systemic\" approaches to carbon reduction. The former is concerned with individual citizen actions and consumption decisions that can be made to lower their \"personal carbon footprint\" (e.g. eating less meat). The latter, on the other hand, focuses on the institutions that shape collective action. While the distinction between individualism and structuralism – which we define broadly to include approaches described as \"institutional,\" \"systemic,\" and \"collectivist\" – is intuitive and widely accepted, the two approaches are frequently depicted as antagonistic, as if one is the superior route to decarbonization and pursuing the other is somehow antithetical to pursuing the other.
